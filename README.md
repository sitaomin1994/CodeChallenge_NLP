### Eluvio OA data challenge

The dataset is tabular and the features involved should be self-explanatory. We would like for you to come up with a specific problem yourself and solve it properly. This is an “open challenge,” mainly focusing on natural language processing. The problem could be either about predictive modeling or providing analytical insights for some business use cases. Note the problem should be treated as large-scale, as the dataset is large (e.g., >100GB) and will not fit into the RAM of your machine. Python is strongly recommended in terms of the coding language.

## Instruction

- model folder contains LSTM and CNN model implemented using pytorch
- Dataloader, NNRegressor is used for training deep learning model

```shell
# Run LSTM-FUSI model
python3 main.py
```

- Eluvio OA.ipynb include all results and analyzing process
- result.pdf shows the result for all models
